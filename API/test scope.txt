As API test scope was not included here, i did very limited test here which is only related with Functional Test. 

But here a lot of API test scope has,
1. Details manual test possible by chcking all cases with all data, response, endpoints, parameter, exception and error handling data etc.
2. It can be possible API automation with Postman, Python, Locust or Jmeter
3. API Load Test Can be possible with Locust, Jmeter
and many more check can be possible by depending on requirement and expectation and test cases
