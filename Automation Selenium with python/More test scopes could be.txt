Here it can be possible to do more automation by doing more scripting and checking:

1. Before Balance element
2. It's amount calculatin status by writting script and using elements from selenium
3. Aftrer Balance Element
4. It's Amount calculation status
5. Search result sowing correctly or not chekcing
6. Transection Update check
7. Previous date input update check 
3. Database connection with Python and checking Turnover amount

But for limited time and scopes, I could not do that currently. 
Also, if some elements tracking would be easier i front-end interface CSS would use specific id/Selector.
It is better for usual UI automation and less costly and healthy.

- Selenium Webdriver using Python can be run by using Docker also, For limited i could not provide it.
