I've updated docker-compose.yml file to achive the following: 

1) Added a PHPMyAdmin docker container and linked it to the existing MySQL container so that I can test and check the data from the mysql tables easily. 

2) Exposed 3316 port of the MySQL container sot that we can connect to MySQL from localhost using MySQL WorkBench or SQLYog like desktop based softwares
